# Inters Machine Learning Projects

## 1. Predict Restaurant Ratings
This project leverages machine learning to predict restaurant ratings based on customer reviews, restaurant features, and other relevant data. It involves:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent values.  
- Feature engineering to identify key factors affecting restaurant ratings.  
- Training and testing multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for optimal predictions.  
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## 2. Restaurant Recommendation
A recommendation system designed to suggest restaurants to users based on their preferences and behavior. Key features include:  
- Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches for personalized recommendations.  
- Implementation of matrix factorization techniques for enhanced accuracy.  
- Use of real-world datasets to simulate user preferences and restaurant features.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Surprise  
- Matplotlib  
- Flask (optional for deployment)

## 3. Cuisine Classification
A classification project aimed at identifying the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients. Highlights include:  
- Use of text preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stemming) for ingredient data.  
- Training classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.  
- Achieving high accuracy with hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
